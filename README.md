# What is done?
- The castle walls + pillars.
- The castle floor + roof.
- The castle's gate.
- The main element (The room inside).

# What remains?
- The inner room is not fully done. Need to add more elements (torches, carpets, etc..).
- I decided to cut the workload from 4 rooms to a single room because of time. Other than that, I think I like what I have ;-;.
