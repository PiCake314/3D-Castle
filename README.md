# Why do I deserve an A?
- I used the concepts we learnt in class to create complex shapes such as the towers which are made of cylinders using GL_TRIANGLE_FAN.
- I added a pillow to the bed even though it was the most complex shape I made.
- I added a flag to the castle :)
- Outside lights switch off when entering the castle, and vice versa.
- The movment is very polished and smooth (uses mouse).
- I added multiple different light sources.

Overall, the project itself taught me a lot more about openGL than the assignments since I got to spend a lot more time into 1 project. I also got more comfortable with creating complex shapes. I think I got what I the class was trying to teach me and I feel like I can create anything I want using openGL now.
